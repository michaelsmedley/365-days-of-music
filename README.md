365 days of music tries to serve 2 purposes. Firstly, it is to give me a push to actually listen to a new music album a day, mainly by going through a playlist of 1500+ starred songs I have collected over the years. Secondly, it is to serve as a playground for me to explore and experiment with more front end tools that I haven't had as much experience in using recently.

The project was built using Angular 1.4 with Grunt helping deal with JS/CSS.

Offers basic introductions to directives and other basic angular functionality
